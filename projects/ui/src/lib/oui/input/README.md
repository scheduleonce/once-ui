`ouiInput` is a directive that allows native `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements to work with
[`<oui-form-field>`](https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview).

<!-- example(input-overview) -->

### `<input>` and `<textarea>` attributes

All of the attributes that can be used with normal `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements can be used
on elements inside `<oui-form-field>` as well. This includes Angular directives such as `ngModel`
and `formControl`.

The only limitation is that the `type` attribute can only be one of the values supported by
`ouiInput`.

### Supported `<input>` types

The following [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) can
be used with `ouiInput`:

- text

### Future supported `<input>` types (Not implemented so far)

This is under development and the following [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) can
be used with `ouiInput` in future:

- color
- date
- datetime-local
- email
- month
- number
- password
- search
- tel
- time
- url
- week

### Changing when error messages are shown

The `<oui-form-field>` allows you to [associate error messages] with your `ouiInput`. By default, these error messages are shown when the control is invalid and either the user has interacted with (touched) the element or the parent form has been submitted. If you wish to override this behavior (e.g. to show the error as soon as the invalid control is dirty or when a parent form group is invalid), you can use the `errorStateMatcher` property of the `ouiInput`. The property takes an instance of an `ErrorStateMatcher` object. An `ErrorStateMatcher` must implement a single method `isErrorState` which takes the `FormControl` for this `ouiInput` as well as the parent form and returns a boolean indicating whether errors should be shown. (`true` indicating that they should be shown, and `false` indicating that they should not.)

<!-- example(input-error-state-matcher) -->

A global error state matcher can be specified by setting the `ErrorStateMatcher` provider. This
applies to all inputs. For convenience, `ShowOnDirtyErrorStateMatcher` is available in order to
globally cause input errors to show when the input is dirty and invalid.

### Example usages

```html
<input ouiInput [errorStateMatcher]="matcher" />
```

```ts
/** Error when invalid control is dirty, touched, or submitted. */
export class MyErrorStateMatcher implements ErrorStateMatcher {
  isErrorState(
    control: FormControl | null,
    form: FormGroupDirective | NgForm | null
  ): boolean {
    const isSubmitted = form && form.submitted;
    return !!(
      control &&
      control.invalid &&
      (control.dirty || control.touched || isSubmitted)
    );
  }
}

matcher = new MyErrorStateMatcher();
```

## API

Directive that allows a native input to work inside a OuiFormField.

Selector: `input[ouiInput], textarea[ouiInput]`

Exported as: `ouiInput`

| Input | Type   | Default | Required | Description                |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| type  | string | text    | no       | Input type of the element. |

### Accessibility

The `ouiInput` directive works with native `<input>` to provide an accessible experience.

If the containing <oui-form-field> has a label it will automatically be used as the aria-label for the `<input>`.
However, if there's no label specified in the form field, aria-label, aria-labelledby or <label for=...> should be added.
