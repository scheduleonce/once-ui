# 4. Add readme for each component for documentation

Date: 2018-12-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Components should be well documented so that the users of the library will be able to quickly start using the component.

## Decision

For now, we will create a README.md file inside each component folder, adjacent to the code for the component. The readme file should have the same structure and highlight some use cases, code examples and have api reference.

## Consequences

Developers can use the components they need quickly without going through too much documentation and without having the experiment too much.
