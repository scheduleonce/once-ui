# 5. Publish the library on npm

Date: 2018-12-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Need to find a way for developers to import this library into their own projects.

## Decision

We will use npm to publish the library privately in [MyGet](https://www.myget.org) (a 3rd party npm compatible registry)

## Consequences

Importing the library is as easy as running `npm install @once/ui`
