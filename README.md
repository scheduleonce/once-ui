# Our release process

We are following a branch strategy for releasing the prerelease and final versions.

- `major/minor/patch` : all these versions will be published from the `master` branch.
- `prerelease --preid=beta`: all the prerelease version will be published from the `qa` branch.

#### Patch releases

The patch builds (1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) are prepared based on commits in the `master` branch;
it contains only non-breaking changes.

#### Minor releases

The minor builds (1.1.0, 1.2.0, etc.) can contain changes related to HTML, APIs, CSS, and UX.

#### Prerelease releases

The prerelease builds (1.0.1-beta.0, 1.0.1-beta.1, etc.) are prepared based on commits in the `qa` branch;

## Publishing a new package

1. Update the package version in ui folder.
2. Run `npm run package`
3. The above command will generate the versioned tarball file in the dist directory. For example if
   the file name is oncehub-ui-0.2.19.tgz then you can publish this file using command `npm publish ./dist/ui/oncehub-ui-0.2.19.tgz`

# Browser Support

We supports the most recent versions of all the major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE11/edge.
